HW5-Third Party API-Day Planner

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## My Experience
Utilizing moment.js along with Jquery/Javascript to set a reactive date and time this app should display the date and color code the current, future, and past time slots. My previous experience in bootstrap helped me set the layout of the HTML page.
Unfortunately I could never get my local storage to work. I experienced major difficulties before realizing my originally gifted jquery, and moment links were not working.
